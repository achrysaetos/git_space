Express 101, from The Odin Project
----------------------------------
Middleware is just a plain JavaScript function that Express will call for you when it receives a network request 
before it fires off a response.

Three middleware function arguments are: req, res, and next. If you are writing or using middleware that does not send
a response back to the users client then you MUST call the next function at the end of your middleware function.
The next function will just tell express to move to the next middleware in the stack, but if you forget to call it then your
app will pause and nothing will happen.

app.use(middleware_name) tells Express you want to use the middleware function you just wrote. Order matters! Middleware 
functions will always run in the order that they are instantiated using app.use().

You might want to add a .gitignore file to make sure you do not upload your node_modules folder to GitHub. This directory is 
quite large, and anyone who wants to clone the project can just run "npm install" to get all these dependencies anyway.

CRUD and MVC, from The Odin Project
-----------------------------------
CRUD stands for create, read, update, and delete entries in the database.
Roughly, create corresponds to POST, read correlates to GET, update correlates to PUT, and delete corresponds to DELETE.

MVC stands for model, view, and controller, and refers to the architecture of your code.
Models are the basic building blocks of your database. They define the types of information that get used by your views
and controllers.
Views are the components that generate the UI for your application.
Controllers are the components that decide what view to display and what information needs to be put in.
